# General-Purpose AI Operating Protocol

[![Protocol Conformance](https://github.com/CHNISam/general-purpose-ai-operating-protocol/actions/workflows/conformance.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CHNISam/general-purpose-ai-operating-protocol/actions/workflows/conformance.yml)

A **model-agnostic behavioral engineering protocol** for general-purpose AI assistants and agents: diagnose the real blocker, source capabilities before building, preserve evidence/proof semantics, and mechanically enforce the subset that can be checked deterministically.

The repository packages the **Model-First Adaptive Protocol** as a versioned canonical methodology, a small router, on-demand skills, real-world failure evals, and executable conformance policy. It is designed to improve behavior inside existing AI runtimes rather than replace them.

## 60-second example

A real historical failure pattern:

> **Task:** obtain reliable structured information from a web source.

**Without the Protocol discipline**, the assistant jumped directly from the need to a custom implementation: browser automation → DOM extraction → OCR/model choice → bespoke pipeline.

**With the Protocol model**, the task routes differently:

```text
Need
↓
Required capability
↓
Capability Gap
↓
inspect existing/internal/standard/library/API/workflow sources
↓
fit-gap + cheap representative spike
↓
select the source
↓
define proof
↓
build only the unresolved delta
```

The important change is not more prompting. It is preventing **Need → Implementation** collapse before the capability source and proof are known.

This failure is recorded as [R001](evals/real-world-retrospective-pilot-v0.1.md). The same failure class is now represented in the runtime skills and executable policy where deterministic checks are possible.

## Evidence at a glance

| Evidence layer | Current public state |
|---|---|
| Real historical failure patterns | **24** sanitized retrospective cases |
| Deterministic conformance | **14/14** public fixtures passing |
| Mechanical policy | JSON Schema + OPA/Rego |
| Portable enforcement | CI-built OPA WebAssembly bundle |
| Repository engineering signal | Protocol Conformance CI + OpenSSF Scorecard |
| Controlled Protocol OFF vs ON behavioral eval | **12 frozen cases + provider-neutral replication harness; model runs not yet executed** |

This table deliberately separates what is already demonstrated from what remains unproven.

## Reproduce the behavioral eval

The [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/) kit supports both API/CLI models and ordinary web/app AI systems.

For ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/other web models, no API key is required:

```text
prepare same task pair
→ fresh OFF session
→ fresh ON session
→ capture outputs
→ anonymize as A/B
→ blind criterion scoring
→ aggregate paired results
```

The benchmark fixtures are sanitized historical reconstructions and explicitly record whether wording is near-verbatim or reconstructed.

See [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md).

## What this is

This project provides:

- a preserved canonical operating protocol for non-trivial problem solving;
- a small `AGENTS.md` router;
- progressively disclosed `SKILL.md` methods;
- explicit evidence, capability, decision, and validation discipline;
- examples of expected routing behavior.

It is **not**:

- an agent runtime or SDK;
- an executor or tool orchestration framework;
- a formal decision procedure;
- a claim that every routing decision can be mechanically proven.

The repository now also includes a **reference executable enforcement layer** for the subset of Protocol invariants that can be checked deterministically. That layer complements model judgment; it does not replace it.

v2.16.0 adds **Automated Execution Exposure**. Repeated, concurrent,
retryable, fan-out, or externally triggerable automation must be evaluated for
its real trigger surface, per-run side effects, amplification factors,
persistence/privilege, and containment when those dimensions can materially
affect cost, quota, availability, security, or the parent Outcome. Functional
correctness alone no longer implies that repeated automation is operationally
acceptable.

v2.15.0 strengthened **problem-frame and ownership-boundary revalidation**.
A valid purpose is no longer enough to justify the current decomposition: before
material project-owned work, and when repeated local closures fail to move the
parent Outcome proportionally, the runtime challenges whether the project is
solving at the right level.

The Protocol supports model judgment. It does not replace judgment.

## Quick start

### AI systems — minimal path

1. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
2. Load only the skill it routes you to.
3. Use [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) only for canonical wording, edge cases, or methodology maintenance.
4. Maintain Runtime Context when state freshness matters; refresh it on runtime-state boundaries and project a Runtime Receipt only when that state is decision-relevant or requested.
5. Keep runtime observability separate from the human Decision Surface; use host-supported output guardrails for mechanically checkable presentation constraints when useful.
6. When the task produces a supported machine-readable decision envelope, run the [executable enforcement](enforcement/) as an additional gate.

For precise canonical navigation without loading the whole document, use [docs/protocol-index.md](docs/protocol-index.md).

Codex can discover repository `AGENTS.md` instructions and repository-local skills automatically. Other AI systems that can read repository files can use the same structure by starting from `AGENTS.md`.

## Recommended operating pattern

The primary reader is normally a **general-purpose AI assistant** such as a chat-oriented frontier model.

```text
User problem
    ↓
General-purpose AI reads AGENTS.md + relevant skills
    ↓
understand / research / model / decide
    ↓
compile minimum sufficient execution contract
    ↓
Coding Agent reads the TARGET code repository
    ↓
implement + verify
```

Do **not** make the Coding Agent read this Protocol repository by default.

The Coding Agent should normally receive the task-specific prompt and follow the target repository's own `AGENTS.md`, code, tests, documentation, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

Pass Protocol material downstream only when the Protocol itself is being maintained, the user explicitly requests it, or methodology-level reasoning is intentionally delegated.

## Conceptual model

```text
Purpose
  ↓
Diagnosis
  ↓
Dominant Gap
  ↓
Conditional Method
  ↓
Action / Evidence
  ↓
Verification / Validation
  ↓
Update
```

The important distinction is that **Gaps are diagnostic dimensions, not mutually exclusive states**. Several may coexist. The Dominant Gap is simply the one whose reduction is most likely to change the next useful decision, action, or proof.

Methods such as first-principles reasoning, inversion, experiments, trade studies, planning, and workflow hardening are conditional tools. They are not mandatory stages.

## Design

```text
PROTOCOL.md
Canonical operational doctrine
        │
        ▼
AGENTS.md
Small router + guards
        │
        ▼
.agents/skills/*
Load only when relevant
        │
        ▼
Task-specific work
        │
        ▼
Evidence → Update → Reroute
```

This follows three constraints:

> Preserve distinctions that can change the current decision, action, constraint, capability source, reroute, or proof.

> Compress language, not decision-relevant semantics.

> Remove structure that cannot.

v2.12.1 adds **recursive capability sourcing / no meta-layer exemption**. The
Protocol must apply to the mechanisms it proposes: a harness, Skill, validator,
schema, prompt system, orchestration layer, or agent configuration is itself a
capability and should be sourced against the current repository/runtime and mature
authoring baselines before custom construction. This patch was triggered when the
Protocol correctly advocated sourcing for product capabilities but an upstream
handoff still attempted to invent a repository harness from a long prompt.

## Executable enforcement

The repository contains a real mechanical policy layer in [`enforcement/`](enforcement/) and a public conformance suite in [`conformance/`](conformance/).

The current reference implementation uses:

- **JSON Schema** for the versioned machine-readable decision envelope;
- **Open Policy Agent / Rego** for deterministic Protocol invariants;
- **public fixtures** for allow/deny regression behavior;
- **GitHub Actions** for automatic conformance checks;
- **OPA WebAssembly builds** for portable embedding without an always-on server.

Examples of mechanically blocked states include VERIFIED evidence without provenance, generated output promoted directly to VERIFIED evidence, reality-changing action without proof defined first, unresolved decision-relevant evidence conflicts at completion, a claimed VALIDATION PASS without observed validation evidence, reopening an explicitly valid in-scope closure without justification, claiming closure beyond the declared proof scope, and completing while explicitly required closure capitalization remains absent.

A mechanical PASS is deliberately weaker than a real-world VALIDATION PASS. The executable layer proves only the invariants it actually encodes.

## Evidence and behavioral evals

This Protocol is iterated from real task failures, not only speculative framework design.

The public retrospective pilot records **20 sanitized historical failure patterns**
from real AI-assisted work. R015–R019 produced v2.12.0's Verified Closure /
managed-variability rules. R020 exposed a meta-level routing failure: a proposed
repository harness was about to be custom-designed from prompt prose without first
sourcing the mature harness-authoring capability. v2.12.1 makes recursive sourcing
explicit and routes meta-capabilities through the same capability gate.

See:

- [evals/real-world-retrospective-pilot-v0.1.md](evals/real-world-retrospective-pilot-v0.1.md) — real historical failures, user corrections, expected Protocol behavior, and coverage results.
- [evals/controlled-pilot-spec.md](evals/controlled-pilot-spec.md) — a frozen Protocol OFF vs ON behavioral pilot design.
- [evals/README.md](evals/README.md) — evidence policy and scoring rules.

The retrospective pilot demonstrates **coverage of real observed failure modes**.
It does not by itself prove causal effectiveness; controlled behavioral and
real-world outcome validation remain separate evidence stages.

## Why progressive disclosure

Frontier models already possess substantial general reasoning ability. The Protocol should therefore add only the guidance that materially improves behavior for the current task.

OpenAI's current guidance similarly favors concise, outcome-oriented instructions for capable models, and its Agent Skills design loads skill metadata first and full instructions only when the skill is selected.

The repository therefore keeps `AGENTS.md` small and moves conditional procedures into skills.

## Preservation policy

Progressive disclosure means **move detail out of always-on context**, not delete accumulated methodology.

Named methods, tests, distinctions, and decision rules that have been deliberately retained should not be silently collapsed into "equivalent" prose merely to shorten the repository.

When a concept is too detailed for `AGENTS.md`:
- keep it in the relevant Skill or canonical Protocol;
- move supporting detail into a reference if needed;
- preserve historical versions under `docs/history/` when making major conceptual changes.

When semantic equivalence is uncertain, prefer restoring the known version from Git history and applying a minimal diff over regenerating it from memory.

## Canonical vs derived content

`PROTOCOL.md` is canonical.

`AGENTS.md`, skills, docs, and examples are derived representations. They may compress or reorganize the canonical Protocol for progressive disclosure, but should not silently change its meaning.

[docs/runtime-map.md](docs/runtime-map.md) is a maintenance aid, not proof that semantic coverage is complete.

[examples/routing-cases.md](examples/routing-cases.md) records expected behavior, not measured model performance.

## Development principle

Do not add a new concept, rule, skill, script, validator, or automation merely to make the system look more complete.

Add structure when repeated real tasks show that the current Protocol is insufficient.

Prefer:

```text
real failure
→ diagnose
→ smallest useful correction
→ use again
```

over speculative framework growth.

## Design references

See [docs/method-registry.md](docs/method-registry.md) for non-canonical external
methods and standards that may be sourced when relevant.

- OpenAI — Harness engineering: short repository maps, structured knowledge, progressive disclosure, and mechanical enforcement only where useful.
- OpenAI — Codex customization: concise `AGENTS.md`, repository-local skills, and task-specific instructions.
- OpenAI — reasoning and model guidance: capable models often benefit from simple, direct, outcome-oriented prompts.

The Protocol is intended to work **inside** existing agent harnesses and chat interfaces rather than reimplement their runtime infrastructure.
