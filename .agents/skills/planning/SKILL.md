name: planning
description: Plan execution when the direction is already chosen but multiple dependent actions, ordering constraints, shared convergence points, capacity/backpressure constraints, gates, or feedback points must be resolved. Do not use planning to hide an unresolved Model, Evidence, Decision, or Capability Gap, and do not produce planning artifacts when one obvious action exists.

# Planning

Use this skill for a **Planning Gap**.

The direction should already be sufficiently selected.

Determine only what materially enables execution:

- prerequisites;
- blockers;
- ordering;
- parallelizable work;
- shared convergence points / serialization bottlenecks;
- sustainable concurrency / in-flight work when fan-out shares constrained downstream capacity;
- backpressure / admission behavior when downstream capacity saturates;
- capability dependencies;
- gates;
- stopping conditions;
- feedback points.

A plan exists to enable execution.

A plan is not evidence.

## Rules

- Do not manufacture steps for procedural completeness.
- Do not plan around a missing capability source; resolve the Capability Gap first.
- Do not use planning to hide missing evidence.
- Make destructive, irreversible, production, migration, release, expensive, or high-risk gates explicit.
- Prefer the smallest executable plan that preserves important dependencies and feedback.
- Do not infer safe concurrency merely because tasks have no direct dependency. When outputs must later reconcile through shared evolving state or a scarce reviewer / validator / integrator, plan against sustainable convergence capacity and treat unconverged work as inventory.

## Exit

When the next executable intervention and its prerequisites are clear:

1. define proof;
2. execute;
3. observe reality;
4. reroute based on evidence.
